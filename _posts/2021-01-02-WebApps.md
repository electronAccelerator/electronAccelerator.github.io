# Dangers of Feature Bloat
It's been some time, but I've started with learning how to make web applications. 

This is because I've been planning to make two web application projects that perform different functionalities:

## Image Scraper + saved sources
Take in images from an inputted tumblr/twitter/website url and save it to a database (or local machine) along with user generated tags and the caption (if any) from the original post.

This then extended to how to view such images, then filter the images seen with tags. On django, there's a learning curve when trying to implement exactly what's said here. Then, I started thinking about tags that show how many current posts that are under the specific tag, along with tag autocomplete and- let's just move onto the other web app project

## Wiki-like website
This is mainly because I want to run a dungeons and dragons campaign that utilizes a wiki to organize the worldbuilding so everyone's on the same page regarding lore.

This is much more difficult than anticipated, because of the previous mention of feature bloat. 

It's the funniest thing because I'm the only end user here, as far as it stands right now. 

To make things easier for future me, I should be able to make things easier for a hypothetical future where I would use all these features. Additionally, there's a deep set belief I have that there's something I'm missing in regards to my own understanding so therefore I need to research and learn more.

Of course, this is somewhat ridiculous when taken too far. I've spent around 2 hours so far just reading up on how to code more efficiently/properly without doing any actual solid coding. It's kind of like that [story with designing clay pots vs making as many shitty ones as you can](https://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2019/01/art-and-fear.html).

But, I found a fun command on Windows which utilizes Git Bash to copy the contents of a file into a clipboard, with `cat filename | clip`

Right now, I'm going to try and break down the projects into the smallest pages and then check if that works. Which brings me to the next problem:

# Web Application frameworks

There's just so many frameworks that it's difficult to decide which one would be the most optimized for the two cases I'm workng on. There's the worry that once a framework is decided, it will be very difficult to move onto another one if there was a mistake in the initial decision.

This is silly. The two projects above shouldn't take so much time in updating and probably won't be maintained beyond their initial release, but the worry is still there. 

In conclusion, all of these complaints are inconsequential compared to just shutting up and doing the projects. However, it's probably best to be aware of the flaws in this current approach and take the awareness to future projects. I still hate it here though, because more than ever I'm aware of my own ignorance.
