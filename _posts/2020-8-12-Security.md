title: Security+, Starting out with Studying!
---

I've watched a few videos on how to start with a career in Cyber Security, and there's a pretty heavy emphasis on getting certificates. However it seems that there's only
certain certificates that are actually valuable- and looking at the chart that's updated yearly that cover the areas of cyber security gives me a headache.

Since I have no idea what I'm doing, I'm going to start with studying for my Security+ certificate. The SY0-601 study guide doesn't even ship to my location which is very cool. 
And it launches in November this year, so there aren't any guides for right now. I doubt that it will change in a major way, so I think that studying from the SY0-501 should be 
fine for right now.

I think this may be a struggle for me as someone starting later than usual, but I have complete faith in my stubbornness. 

I'm going to start off with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/i7hx4t/master_list_i_compiled_and_ranked_every_major/"></a>. Reddit's a nice place to start (I think?) on 
gathering resources. I usually like going through the comments on posts to see what other people have to say.

Like in that link above, one of the comments mentions someone named Mike Chappel. His website mentions a study group which you can sign up for, so I'll see if it spams you or 
is actually useful.

There's also a 8 dollar app at <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.learnzapp.securityplus"></a> which comments mentioned also are very helpful for multiple choice.
To be honest I think that 8 dollars is a lot for an app but as a one time purchase it should be fine, but if there's an app that comes immediately after
for the 601 version I'll be kind of upset.

To start, I'm going to get the CompTIA Security+ Get Certified Get Ahead: SY0-501 Study Guide by Darril Gibson and Professor Messer's videos.
